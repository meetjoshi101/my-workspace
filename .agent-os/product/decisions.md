## July 25, 2025: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

TaskFlow will be developed as a SaaS project management platform focusing on unified multi-level planning (project → sprint → daily tasks) with a strong emphasis on individual contributor experience. The platform will target development teams of 5-50 people and use Node.js/Angular with SQLite for initial development.

### Context

The project management tool market is saturated with manager-focused solutions that create friction for individual contributors. There's a clear opportunity to build a developer-first planning tool that bridges the gap between high-level project planning and daily task execution. The decision to start with a focused MVP and expand through 5 development phases allows for validated learning and iterative improvement.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Build a Comprehensive Enterprise Tool from Day 1**
   - Pros: Complete feature set, immediate enterprise readiness
   - Cons: Extended development time, high complexity, unclear market fit

2. **Focus Only on Daily Task Management**
   - Pros: Simple scope, quick to market
   - Cons: Limited differentiation, doesn't solve multi-level planning problem

3. **Manager-First Approach (Like Existing Tools)**
   - Pros: Proven market approach, clear buying personas
   - Cons: Perpetuates existing user experience problems, high competition

### Rationale

**Key factors in decision:**

1. **Market Gap:** Clear opportunity in developer-focused project management tools
2. **Technical Feasibility:** Chosen tech stack aligns with team expertise and scalability needs
3. **Iterative Approach:** 5-phase roadmap allows for market validation and course correction
4. **Differentiation:** Bottom-up planning approach provides clear competitive advantage

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear product positioning in underserved market segment
- Technical stack optimized for rapid development and scaling
- Phased approach reduces risk and enables early user feedback
- Strong foundation for future enterprise features

**Negative:**
- Initial market size limited to development teams
- Need to educate market on bottom-up planning benefits
- Competition with established players with deeper pockets
- Technical complexity of multi-level planning integration

## July 25, 2025: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt Node.js/Express backend with Angular frontend, SQLite for development, and plan PostgreSQL migration for production. Use TailwindCSS for styling and DaisyUI for components.

### Context

Need to select technologies that enable rapid MVP development while providing a path to enterprise scalability. Team has experience with JavaScript ecosystem and modern web development practices.

<!-- ### Alternatives Considered

1. **React + Next.js Frontend**
   - Pros: Large ecosystem, team familiarity
   - Cons: Less opinionated structure, potential over-engineering

2. **PostgreSQL from Day 1**
   - Pros: Production-ready, advanced features
   - Cons: Additional development setup complexity

3. **Python/Django Backend**
   - Pros: Rapid development, strong ecosystem
   - Cons: Team less experienced, different deployment considerations -->

### Rationale

- **Angular:** Provides structured development approach suitable for complex applications
- **SQLite → PostgreSQL:** Start simple, migrate when scaling demands require it
- **TailwindCSS + DaisyUI:** Rapid UI development with consistent design system

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid development capabilities with familiar technologies
- Clear scaling path from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- Consistent UI development with utility-first CSS

**Negative:**
- Angular learning curve for team members unfamiliar with framework
- Database migration complexity when moving to PostgreSQL
- Potential over-engineering risk with full framework stack
