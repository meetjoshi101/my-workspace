# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-25-user-authentication/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-25
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **JWT Token Generation**: Use jsonwebtoken library with HS256 algorithm and 24-hour expiration
- **Password Hashing**: Implement bcrypt with salt rounds of 12 for secure password storage
- **Email Validation**: Validate email format using regex and check for uniqueness in database
- **Password Strength**: Minimum 8 characters with at least one uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- **Session Management**: Store JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies for security
- **Email Verification**: Generate unique verification tokens with 24-hour expiration
- **API Middleware**: Create authentication middleware to protect routes requiring login
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses for authentication failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement basic rate limiting on login/registration endpoints

## Approach Options

**Option A: Session-based Authentication**
- Pros: Server-side session control, immediate revocation capability
- Cons: Requires session storage, not scalable for multiple servers

**Option B: JWT-based Authentication (Selected)**
- Pros: Stateless, scalable, includes user data in token, industry standard
- Cons: Token revocation complexity, larger payload size

**Rationale:** JWT tokens align with modern SaaS architecture and will support future microservices scaling. The stateless nature reduces server memory requirements and enables easier horizontal scaling.

## External Dependencies

- **jsonwebtoken** - JWT token generation and verification
  - **Justification:** Industry standard library for JWT handling with good security practices
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing and comparison
  - **Justification:** Secure password hashing with adjustable difficulty
- **joi** - Input validation for registration/login forms
  - **Justification:** Comprehensive validation library with good error messaging
- **nodemailer** - Email sending for verification emails
  - **Justification:** Popular Node.js email library with multiple transport options
- **express-rate-limit** - Rate limiting middleware
  - **Justification:** Prevents brute force attacks on authentication endpoints

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Requirements
- User table with id, email, password_hash, email_verified, created_at, updated_at
- Email verification tokens table with token, user_id, expires_at

### Frontend Components (Angular)
- LoginComponent with reactive forms
- RegisterComponent with password confirmation
- AuthGuard for route protection
- AuthService for token management

### Backend Architecture
- Authentication middleware for route protection
- User controller with register/login/logout endpoints
- Email service for verification emails
- JWT utility functions for token operations

### Security Considerations
- Store JWT in httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement CSRF protection for cookie-based auth
- Validate all inputs server-side regardless of frontend validation
- Log authentication attempts for security monitoring
