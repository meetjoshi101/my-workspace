# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: User Authentication & Registration
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a secure JWT-based authentication system that allows users to register for TaskFlow accounts and securely log in to access project management features. This foundational feature enables user identity management and secure access control for all subsequent platform functionality.

## User Stories

### User Registration

As a **new user**, I want to **create a TaskFlow account with my email and password**, so that **I can access the project management platform and collaborate with my team**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User visits the registration page
2. User enters email, password, and confirms password
3. System validates email format and password strength
4. System checks if email is already registered
5. If valid, system creates account and sends confirmation email
6. User clicks confirmation link to activate account
7. User is redirected to login page with success message

### User Login

As a **registered user**, I want to **log in with my email and password**, so that **I can access my projects and tasks securely**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User visits login page
2. User enters email and password
3. System validates credentials against database
4. If valid, system generates JWT token
5. System returns token and redirects to dashboard
6. Token is stored securely in browser for subsequent requests

### User Logout

As a **logged-in user**, I want to **securely log out of my account**, so that **my session is terminated and my data remains secure**.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User clicks logout button/link
2. System invalidates current session token
3. System clears authentication data from browser
4. User is redirected to login page

## Spec Scope

1. **User Registration** - Email/password registration with email verification
2. **User Login** - JWT-based authentication with secure token generation
3. **User Logout** - Session termination and token invalidation
4. **Password Security** - Bcrypt hashing and password strength validation
5. **JWT Token Management** - Token generation, validation, and refresh functionality

## Out of Scope

- Social login (Google, GitHub, etc.) - planned for Phase 2
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) - planned for Phase 3
- Password reset functionality - separate spec
- User profile management - separate spec
- Role-based permissions - planned for Phase 5

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Registration Flow** - Users can successfully create accounts and receive email verification
2. **Secure Authentication** - Users can log in and receive valid JWT tokens for API access
3. **Protected Routes** - API endpoints require valid authentication tokens
4. **Session Management** - Users can log out and tokens are properly invalidated
